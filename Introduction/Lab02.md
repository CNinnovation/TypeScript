1. declare and use a variable of type Boolean
2. declare and use a variable of type number

4. If you do not declare a type for a variable, can you change the type after it's first use?

## Try var, let, const

1. Create a function foo and a code block within this function
2. Create variables usign var, let, and const within the code block
3. Access the variables outside of the code block
4. Compile the TypeScript file
5. Correct the script and run it

Questions:

1. What errors do you get accessing variables declared within a code block outside of the code block
2. What kind of variables are allowed to be used in such a scenario?
3. What is the difference between const and let?

## Arithmetic Operators
